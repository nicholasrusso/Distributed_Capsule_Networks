### A Summary of What I Learned Throughout The Quarter
This quarter, I went through a lot of change. I got accepted to my school's masters program, I started my first graduate level classes, and I started trying to narrow down a project I want to work on for my thesis. However, perhaps the largest challenge I faced was tackling one of the newest, least explored types of neural networks: capsule networks. Mind you that at the beginning of this quarter I barely knew what a neural network was. Not only did my team attempt to reproduce the results published in the two papers on capsule networks, but we attempted to take it one step further and do so within a distributed system of computers. Needless to say, I had a lot to learn if I wanted to be valuable to my team in any way. So I wanted to dedicate one of my blog posts to recapping several of the main topics I learned about throughout the quarter.
