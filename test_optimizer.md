## Testing method 1: Using different optimizers

Optimization algorithms are the engines that power neural networks in general and enable them to learn patterns from data. Similar to the normal neural network, capsules network need to learn the Weight matrix (Wi,j). The most common algorithm used to train neural networks and deep learning models is gradient descent. Gradient descent has many variants, but, in each case, the idea is the same: iteratively evaluate paramters, compute the loss, then take a small step in the direction that will minimize the loss.
