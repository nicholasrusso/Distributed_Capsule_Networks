### Our Implementation Plan
We will be using TensorFlow and Keras for our implementation. TensorFlow is a well-known machine learning framework and Keras is a deep learning library running on top of TensorFlow. Keras abstracts TensorFlow commands into a simplified library that allows for quick prototyping and added clarity. We will work on improving [Xifeng Guo's implementation](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras) of the Hinton's paper on capsule networks, in order to focus our energy on the distribution of it. To distribute our code, we will use the [Horovod](https://github.com/uber/horovod) framework. Horovod is a distributed training framework for TensorFlow that uses OpenMPI for message passing between machines. According to experiments run by Uber, the creator of Horovod, it is much faster than using the built-in distribution capabilities of TensorFlow. Horovod also has support for Keras, which allows us to maintain a higher level of abstraction when implementing neural networks.
